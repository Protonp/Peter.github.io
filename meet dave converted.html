				Meet Dave is a comedy about small aliens who live inside a spaceship that looks like a human.
				The spaceship,Dave, is played by Eddy Murphy, who is also on of my favorite comedians.
				Dave goes through many awkward encounters as he tries to accomplish his quest of draining all the salt from the ocean.

		<h3> Why I like Meet Dave</h3>					
	<p style="color:black;" white> Although old Meet Dave combines comedy and scifi in an amazing way.
			It portrays the super smart aliens as a confused people in an unknown world.
			The movie also goes out of its way to make you laugh as the aliens try to figure out the mysteries of Earth
