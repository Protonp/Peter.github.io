		<h3> Name Project</h3>					
	<u><i><b>When</b></i></u> the green flag is pressed letters of your name must perform different actions.
When the green flag is pressed again it has to reset and start over.
Each letter had to have its own action. <a href="#">Name Project</a>
       
            <h3> What I learned</h3>
	<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks : When the green flag is pressed my letters would perform an action.</li>
			<li>Resetting the program: When the green flag was pressed my letters would go back into place.</li>
			<li>Movement: I rotated and moved letters in certain shapes and patterns.</li>
	</ul>

		<h3> Computer buying project</h3>
		
		
		<u><i><b>I</b></i></u> had to interview and find the best computer for someone. 
Once i had my computer options for them picked out I had to design a presentation to show everyone how i selected the best computer for them. 
I used scratch to make a slideshow presentation. <a href="#">Computer buting presentation</a>

<h3> What I learned</h3>
	<ul>
			<li>Background: How to change the background for each slide when certain events happen.</li>
			<li>Sprites: Using sprites that appear and disappear to show facts and stats.</li>
			<li>Variables: Using Variables to controle specific events in my project</li>
	</ul>
	<h3> Game Project</h3>
	<p> In the project I was required to create a game or a story. The game/story had to have animations along with multiple scenes/levels. If it was a game it was required to have at least two levels that got continuously harder as you went along. 
	</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clones: I figured out how to make clones for specific tasks and have those clones react to the space around them
	</li>Animation: I created an animation that cycled when the sprite jumped or walked
	</li>
	<li>Game over screen: I created a game over screen in the event that the player touched something they shouldnâ€™t
	</li>
	<li> Next level: I created a flag that when touched by the player would change the level to the next stage.
	</li>
	<li> Timer: The timer i made kept track of how long they had been playing the game
	</li>
	<li>Score: The score variable was used to see how many times they touched they main objective
	</li>
